Mission Planning
================

Introduction
------------

The web interface has a mission planning tool, allowing users to
define missions based on waypoints and tasks.

Waypoints
---------

Waypoints are the core component of a mission. Without waypoints,
there is no mission.

Tasks
-----

Tasks can optionally be assigned to waypoints, so that when Tiberius
reaches a waypoint a task can be carried out.
