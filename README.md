# Introduction

Tiberius is an autonomous robot, the robot has been in development since 2005 by Masters students at Heriot-Watt University.

# Documentation

We have published documentation on [readthedocs.org](http://tiberius-robot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), and try to include extensive docstrings.

# Testing

Our testing module contains everything you need to test the functions of Tiberius.
It includes functional tests that requires Tiberius to be positioned at the start of the test environment. The tests will then run, checking that Tiberius is acting as it should.
