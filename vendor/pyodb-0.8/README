PyODB is an ODBC Python module. It presents a simplified interface to the
unixODBC API allowing users to connect to one or more data sources, execute 
raw SQL commands and fetch the results of queries. The Python unixODBC 
bindings were created using SWIG (http://www.swig.org).

Requirements:
	python - http://www.python.org
	unixODBC - http://www.unixodbc.org
	database - any that supports unixODBC (PostgreSQL, Informix, etc)

Build:
	Check the settings of runtime_library_dirs and library_dirs 
	in the setup.py:

	runtime_library_dirs - location of the unixODBC runtime library
	library_dirs - location of the unixODBC library

	Run command: python setup.py build

Install:
	Run command: python setup.py install (as root)

Usage:
	See the sample code in example.py and read the quickstart.html

Hopefully this is enough information to get started.
