-- NOTE: this is ILLUSTRATIVE CODE, provided on an 'as is' basis to help

This directory shows one way of using the CLC module for initiating and 
controlling a polyhedra database and associated clients.  The 'runner' 
module takes a series of parameters, allowing the user to specify the 
command line used to fire off the database server, and the commands to 
fire off once the database is running; for the latter, one can specify 
both the one-shots and also the ones to fire off repeatedly.  For the 
demo, the runner is configured (via poly.cfg) to fire off the 'animate' 
and 'active' programs, thereby automating much of demo_1.  

-----------------
RUNNING SEQUENCE:
-----------------

if you need to recreate the saved database, copy it over from demo_1.  To 
run this demo, then issue the command 

	start clc runner
	
... if running on Windows, or 

	clc runner &
	
...  if running on a Unix-like platform.  To stop the database, you can 
either kill the process or (using sqlc) shut it down; either way, the 
runner will stat it up again.  To stop the demo, kill the runner process 
and then kill or shut down the database.  
  
The poly.cfg file contains some descriptive comments, and there are also 
comments at the front of the file runner.cl that give full deteail on how 
to configure it.  

NOTE 1: if the database is already running when the runner is started, 
then the runner program can be configured to stop (since it cannot claim 
control of the database process and kill it if it seems to be locked up, 
and there may also be existing client applications running against the 
database).  In this demo, it is configured to be lax - which does mean the 
wrong database may be running, or the database may already have an 
animator running.  

NOTE 2: if the test.dat file is damaged for any reason, take a copy of the 
one in the examples/demo_1 directory.
