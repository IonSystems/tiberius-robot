-- NOTE: this is ILLUSTRATIVE CODE, provided on an 'as is' basis to help
-- demonstrate one or more features of the Polyhedra product.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demonstration uses the data replication feature and so is not applicable
to all editions of Polyhedra. Please refer to the feature.txt file for a list
of features supported by each edition of Polyhedra.

This demo provides a poly.cfg file illustrating how to configure a pair of
read-only replicas of a fault-tolerant database.

Running the demo
----------------

Start demo_4 running first, then come back to this directory and run

	rtrdb db3 &
       
... if on a Unix/Linux platform, or, on Windows,

	start rtrdb db3
	
Now you should be able to connect to the replica using the command 

	sqlc sql3
	
(using 'sql1' or 'sql2' in place of 'sql3' in the above will connect you 
to the two databases of the FT pair, if running.)

To demonstrate you can have more than one replica of a database service,
you can use db4 and sql4 in place of db3 and sql3 in the above examples. 

Note that it is also possible to start up a replica of a stand-alone 
database; merely ensure that the server to be replicated had a 
journal_service resource defined.
