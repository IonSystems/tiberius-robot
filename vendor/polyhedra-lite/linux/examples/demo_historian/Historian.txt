-- NOTE: this is ILLUSTRATIVE CODE, provided on an 'as is' basis to help
-- demonstrate one or more features of the Polyhedra product.
-- It may well need adaption for use in a live installation, and
-- Enea Software AB and its agents and distributors do not warrant this code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demonstration uses the historian feature and so is not applicable to all
editions of Polyhedra. Please refer to the feature.txt file for a list of
features supported by each edition of Polyhedra.

This uses the same database as demo_1, but with the configuration file 
altered to enable the historian sub-module of the Polyhedra DBMS.  The SQL 
file init/setup.sql instructs the historian to log changes to the currency 
table, and samples can be retrieved by queries such as...  

    select * from sample where name = 'EUR'
	and timestamp > now() - minutes(5);

...  for raw samples, though when retrieving time-compressed samples the 
granularity has to be given: 
    
    select * from csample where granularity='60s'
        and name='AUD'
        and timestamp > now() - minutes(45)
	and timestamp < now() - minutes(20);

To save away samples before they are overwritten in the circular use of 
buffers, one issues a command such as...

    update logdata
        set archiving=true, 
            archfilename='001.dat',
	    archbuffercount=3
	where rate='0s' and control=1;
    commit;
    
this will cause the oldest 3 un-archived buffers to be written to the file 
001.dat; at a later stage, this can be brought online again by a statement
such as...

    insert into logarchive (filename,  control)
                    values ('001.dat', 1);
    commit;
    
Whilst the archive file is online, the historian sub-module will use the 
data in it to help answer queries on the relevant pseudo-table, in 
conjunction with the data that it normally uses (e.g., the contents of the 
buffer that is being built up, and the contents of the log file).  When 
the archive file is no longer needed, simply delete the logarchive record; 
the historian will release the file, but not delete it.  

Running the demo
----------------

follow the instructions in the evaluation guide re demo 1 to find out how 
to start up the database, to start off the 'animate' client (to change the 
values in the currency table periodically) and to start off the SQLC 
client.  The last allows you to type in SQL queries and changes such as 
those given above.  Have a look at the init/setup.sql file to see how the 
the historian was configured; there are lots of comments, explaining the 
purpose of the records that were inserted into the varous configuration 
tables used by the historian.  

One manual in the Polyhedra reference set is devoted to the topic of the 
historian submodule, and contains further worked examples.
